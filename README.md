# BetterDebugEntry
A Better Sunshine Engine module that adds a setting to launch BSE in debug mode!

Build Instructions:
Make sure to add the BetterSunshineEngine repo into lib/BetterSunshineEngine (more details in the readme in said folder). You will also then need to do the same thing with the sms_interface repo(https://github.com/DotKuribo/SunshineHeaderInterface) in lib/BetterSunshineEngine/lib

Make sure there are no spaces in the name of your folder path from your drive to your repo, otherwise the build will fail!

-> Built off of the template Better Sunshine Engine module(https://github.com/DotKuribo/BetterSunshineModule).
